    <p>This device has been certified in compliance with the government´s requirements for exposure to radio waves. In the United States and Canada, the SAR limit for devices used by the public is 1.6 watts/kilogram (W/kg) averaged over one gram of body tissue. The standard incorporates a margin of safety to give additional protection for the public and to account for any variations in measurements.</p>
    <p>
    
      
      Before a device is available for sale to the public in the US, it must be tested and certified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that it does not exceed the limit established by the government-adopted requirement for safe exposure. The tests are performed in positions and locations (i.e., by the ear and worn on the body) as required by the FCC for each model. The FCC has granted an Equipment Authorisation for this device with all reported SAR levels evaluated as in compliance with the FCC RF exposure guidelines. While there may be differences between the SAR levels of various devices, all devices granted an FCC equipment authorisation meet the government requirement for safe exposure. SAR information on this device is on file at the FCC and can be found by entering the FCC ID of your device at: <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid">transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/</a>. You can find the FCC ID by referring to the relevant label in your device or through the <strong>Certificates</strong> menu in <strong>Settings</strong>.
