	<h1>Limited warranty for Mainland China</h1>
<div>
  <p>Subject to the conditions of this limited warranty, Sony Mobile Communications Inc., or its relevant local affiliate, warrants this device to be free from defects in design, material and workmanship at the time of its original purchase by a consumer, and for a subsequent period of one (1) year. All original accessories delivered with the device will be warranted based on the local mobile 3R policy.</p>
  <p>If, during the warranty period, this device fails to operate under normal use and service, due to defects in design, materials or workmanship, authorised Sony distributors or service partners, in the country/region where you purchased the device, will, at their discretion, either repair, replace or refund the purchase price of the device in accordance with the terms, consumer law and local mobile 3R policy.</p>
  <p>Some of your personal settings, downloads and other information may be lost when your device is repaired or replaced. At present, Sony may be prevented by applicable law, other regulation or technical restrictions from making a backup copy of certain downloads. Sony does not take any responsibility for any lost information of any kind and will not reimburse you for any such loss. You should always make backup copies of all the information stored on your device such as downloads, calendar and contacts before handing in your device for repair or replacement.</p>
  <p>If Sony repairs your device, the repair for the defect concerned shall be warranted for the remaining time of the original warranty period or for thirty (30) days from the date of repair, whichever is longer. Repair may involve the use of functionally-equivalent units. Replaced parts or components will become the property of Sony.</p>
