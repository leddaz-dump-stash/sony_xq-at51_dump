<h2>Devices with 3D viewing capabilities</h2>
<div>
  <p>When viewing 3D images shot with a 3D viewing-capable device, you
    may experience discomfort in the form of eye strain, fatigue, or nausea
    when the images are viewed on a 3D-compatible monitor. To prevent
    these symptoms, we recommend that you take regular breaks. However,
    you need to determine for yourself the length and frequency of the
    breaks you require, as they vary according to the individual. If you
    experience any type of discomfort, stop viewing the 3D images until
    you feel better, and consult a physician as necessary. For additional
    information, refer to the operating instructions included with the
    3D device or 3D software you are using with this device.</p>
